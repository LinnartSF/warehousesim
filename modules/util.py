    this function returns edge indices, derived from the forwarded node index sequence
    edge indices are returned as a list of tuples
    the edge index list returned can be used to access edge references in Layout instances (e.g. .Grid attribute of Model class instance in modelling.py)

    Args:
        nodeseq (list): sequence of nodes for which edges are to be derived (ints)
    
    Returns:
        edgeseq (list): list of derived edge indices (int tuples)
